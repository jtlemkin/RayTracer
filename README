Compile with 'cmake CMakeLists.txt' and then 'make' and run the executable hw5 with the number of pixels you'd like
the width of the screen to be.

I implemented, the camera viewing model, intersections with spheres and planes, refraction, and reflection. I'm not
entirely sure what the requirements are, but if I went above and beyond it I could really use the extra credit :)

The file RayTracedImage is a png of scene produced by the program.

Thanks a lot for a great quarter!
